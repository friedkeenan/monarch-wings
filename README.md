# Monarch Wings

Gain the ability to double jump while wearing an elytra!

While wearing an elytra, a player is able to flap their wings and jump in the air an extra time. This extra jump is more powerful than a normal jump, though be careful not to alert any wardens with the sound of your wings.

Additionally, a player can fall further without taking damage while wearing an elytra, and a player is only able to glide while in the End.
